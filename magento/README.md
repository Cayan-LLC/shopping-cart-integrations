#magento

[Magento](http://magento.com/) offers flexible, scalable eCommerce solutions designed to help you grow and succeed online. Magento's cost-effective technology platform makes it possible for you to control the content, functionality, look and feel of your online store.

The Magento ecommerce platform provides a plug in architecture to self integrate payment and processing products.

Merchant Warehouse is offering two Magento plugins - one supporting Credit & Debit cards, and one supporting Gift cards. These plugins may be used separately or together.

# Quick Usage Guide

## Entering Billing Information

As part of the Magento checkout process, your customers will be prompted for their shipping and billing information. This info will be passed on to other screens later in the checkout process.

After you've entered your billing and payment information, you'll be redirected to MerchantWarehouse's Transport.Web hosted payments page. Here, your customers will be prompted for their credit card information. Most fields will be pre-populated with the information entered on the previous screens. When they're done entering their payment info, they'll be redirected back to your site, and asked to review & finalize their order.
